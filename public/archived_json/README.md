# Archived JSON Files

This directory contains JSON files that were previously used in the LCN-video-viewer application but are no longer actively used. These files have been archived for reference purposes.

## File Descriptions

- **youtube_videos_all.json**: Contains an unfiltered list of all YouTube videos, including those that may not have been included in the final selection.
- **youtube_videos_backup.json**: A backup of the video data from an earlier version of the application.
- **youtube_videos_before_rename.json**: Video data before the video renaming process was applied.
- **youtube_videos_filtered.json**: A version of the video data after applying filters, possibly an intermediate step in video selection.

## Active File

The main application currently uses `youtube_videos.json` in the public directory. This is the file that is copied during the build process and loaded by the application at runtime.

## Archive Date

These files were archived as part of code cleanup and organization.
